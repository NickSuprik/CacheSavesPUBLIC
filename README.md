# Browser Cache Management Tool

## Overview
This powerful and flexible **Browser Cache Management Tool** batch file allows users to **save (backup) and load** their browser cache beyond built-in browser management capabilities. By using a structured command-line interface, users gain greater control over their cache data while ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

## Purpose
Modern browsers offer cache management, but often with limited user control. This tool aims to:
- Allow users to **manually back up** and **restore** browser cache files.
- Provide better cache organization beyond browser defaults.
- Enable cross-platform and multi-language compatibility.

## Supported Browsers (Free Version)
- **Firefox**
- **Google Chrome**

Future paid versions will expand support to **more browsers** and include additional save slots.

## Features
- **Simple CLI Interface**: Navigate menus to **save** or **load** your browser cache with ease.
- **Backup & Restore**: Maintain copies of your browser cache for later use.
- **Cross-Language Expansion Plan**:
  - Future implementations in **Java, PowerShell, Python**, and more.
- **Future GUI Integration**: A graphical interface will be developed for broader accessibility.

## Installation & Usage
1. Download the script and place it in your desired directory.
2. Run the script using a Windows command prompt.
3. Follow the prompts to select:
   - **Save (Backup)** your browser cache.
   - **Load** (restore) previously backed-up cache.
4. The script will create a structured **backup folder** and manage file copies accordingly.
